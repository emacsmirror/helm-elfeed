This README uses [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].

** Features

- List and select feeds with Helm's completion mechanisms and perform specific actions:
      - Show
      - Update
      - Edit (requires [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]])
- Other than your feeds, predefined generic search queries are available:
      - All
      - Marked/starred
      - Unread

** Installation

*** Dependencies

- Helm
- Elfeed
- [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]] (optional, for editing feeds)

*** Installation with Melpa

Assuming [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], just add the following to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-elfeed
	:ensure t
	:after elfeed
	:config
	(define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-elfeed) ; Optional
)
#+END_SRC

*** Installation from Github

Download =helm-elfeed.el= to your =.emacs.d= folder and add the following code to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-elfeed
  :after elfeed
  :load-path "relative/path/to/helm-elfeed.el")
  :config
  (define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-elfeed) ; Optional
)
#+END_SRC

Optionally, you can also download the tests directory.

** Usage

Simple as that: 

=M-x helm-elfeed=

** Configuration

Certain helm-elfeed variables are customizable, see =(customize-group "helm-elfeed")=. 

The following are probably the most relevant ones: 

- =helm-elfeed-generic-search-queries=: list of string pairs =(NAME . QUERY)=, for example, =("All" . "@6-months-ago")=.

** Ideas & plans

As for my own needs, helm-elfeed is currently feature-complete.  

** Alternative and related Emacs packages

- [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/elfeed-summary][elfeed-summary]]: tree-based feed summary interface for elfeed. I had used this before the development of helm-elfeed.
